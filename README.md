# UW-Madison-GI-Tract-Image-Segmentation
Kaggle competition

I want to start this README by thanking my teammates @dssdee @Apolaris and @Jiqing. They were really helpful, and I have learned from them a lot since we have merged. Our final solution was a blend of 2.5D models with psueudo-label. Using imagenet pretraining weight and resnext101 as backbone.

All other approaches we have tried:
CRF, TTA, predicting more slides without labels, mmsegmentation
